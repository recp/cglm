cglm Documentation
================================

**cglm** is optimized 3D math library written in C99 (compatible with C89).
It is similar to original **glm** library except this is mainly for **C**

This library stores matrices as column-major order but in the future row-major
is considered to be supported as optional.

Also currently only **float** type is supported for most operations.
